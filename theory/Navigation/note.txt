1.Navigation between pages with next/link
2. Navigation to a page programmatically using router.push()
3. How prefetching works

Prefetch the page in the background for faster client transitions(by default Link will have prefetch turned On)

Only prefetches links that appear in the viewport

Prefetching is only enabled in production ý nói ở đây là phải chạy run build và sau đó start nó.

Note: Next.js only fetches the Js, it doesn't execute it.
